I am an enthusiastic and driven individual with strong analytical and problem solving skills with the ability to work as part of a team in a highly pressurised environment and meet tight deadlines. I am looking for an opportunity with a progressive company where I can utilise and develop my existing and newly acquired skills at NCIRL to re-engage my career in this industry.
